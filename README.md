# Device Location Assistant
Locate devices through login log scraping. Normally you would have to manually find and open each log file to find a user or a computers login/user history from over 50,000 log files in a single folder. This takes time to open the folder and then find the file. DLA will find and queue the file you are looking for without waiting for the folder to load. This has cut down search times from ~3 minutes down to seconds!
 
 
 Features:
 
 * Loades .log files via username or hostname and lists them in a listbox from most recent.
 * Separates computer and user logins by grade schools (e.g. elementary, junior high, senior high).
 * Ping hostname from software.
 * Finds additional information about the user (e.g. user ID, last login, last password, full name, phone number).
 * Shortcuts to Munis and KAMS (TipWeb IT) for quick access to fixed assets 
 * Print most recent log information.
 * Change the directory for the log files (in case the location ever changes in the future).
